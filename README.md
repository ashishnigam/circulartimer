# CircularTimer

CircularTimer is a class that creates a custom circular timer, showing the percentage completed between two dates.

## Installation
===

Drop the files `CircularTimer.h` and `CircularTimer.m` into your Xcode project.

## Usage
===

In your ViewController import the header file `CircularTimer.h`, and create a CircularTimer property to keep a reference:

`@property (nonatomic, strong) CircularTimer *circularTimer;`

Then, to create the object use a code like this:

```
self.circularTimer = 
[[CircularTimer alloc] initWithPosition:CGPointMake(0.0f, 0.0f)
                                 radius:radius
                         internalRadius:internalRadius
                      circleStrokeColor:circleStrokeColor
                activeCircleStrokeColor:activeCircleStrokeColor
                            initialDate:initialDate
                              finalDate:finalDate
                          startCallback:^{
                              //do something
                          }
                            endCallback:^{
                                //do something
                            }];
```                              

## Methods
===

Create a CircleTimer using:

```
- (id)initWithPosition:(CGPoint)position
                radius:(float)radius
        internalRadius:(float)internalRadius
     circleStrokeColor:(UIColor *)circleStrokeColor
activeCircleStrokeColor:(UIColor *)activeCircleStrokeColor
           initialDate:(NSDate *)initialDate
             finalDate:(NSDate *)finalDate
         startCallback:(void (^)(void))startBlock
           endCallback:(void (^)(void))endBlock;       
```

You can see the meaning of `radius`, `internalRadius`, `circleStrokeColor` and `activeCircleStrokeColor` in this image:

```
- (BOOL)isRunning;
```
Indicates if the CircleTimer is currently running.

```
- (BOOL)willRun;
```
Indicates if the CircleTimer will run (in other words, if the current time is smaller than the CircleTimer `finalDate`).

```
- (void)stop;
```
Stops the CircleTimer.

```
- (NSTimeInterval)intervalLength;
```
Returns the interval between the `initialDate` and the `finalDate`.

```
- (NSTimeInterval)runningElapsedTime;
```
Returns the interval of time elapsed since the CircleTimer started running.
